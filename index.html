  <h1>TCU is a very dangerous place!</h1>
  <p>

My first memory on this planet is myself refusing to eat chicken pot pie.  My father then pulled me out of my chair by my throat, pineed me against the wall eye level.  My mom held the chicken pot pie and screamed at me, while my dad shoved it so far down my throat i can still feel his fingers almost in my stomach.  Then threw me on the floor like a rag.
<p>
Life didn't get much better.

My parents beat me, we were kicked out of school several times because our clothes were so messed up.

Our parents moved into a hotel in Ingelwood, CA. 
I fought everyday for my life.  A school where the kids all wore red or blue, and so did the parents.  When I got away from them, the homeless would try to rape and kill me.

In junior high I had my own fight club.

In high school I ran with Tongans, if you're unfamiliar, Charles Darwin said Tongans fight harder anf better than anyone else in the world, I agree.  
Tongans would say there is only 1 person to fear in a fight..... me.

I set several records in high school football as a lineman, was in Texas Football Magazine, etc.

TCU called me and asked me to be there the next day, on an academic scholarship, and as a tight end, I was there the next day.

Only freshmen were on campus for a week or 2, until the "veterans" came back.  A few hours before they came back my coach said "I hope you're ready to lose that hair."  
I asked around, apparently it is a hazing thing to shave the freshmen's heads prior to team photos.  My hair was down to my shoulders, I just went to a friends house for the night. 
FYI, this is before cell phones were popular.

The next day I was at school super early, had my uniform on, helmet in hand, ready for photos...and ready for whatever might be.
I was sitting in the press area and a teammate walked in, said 
“You must be XXX” "What's it to you?" "They're looking for you" "I figured" "I do not think you understand, they thought the other freshmen were hiding you becuase of your long hair, they kicked the shit out of them last night, the entire tieam is extremely pissed at you right now." "Thanks for the heads up" "I do not think you understand, you need to take that uniform off, leave campus, and never come back, they're going to kill you." "Thanks for the heads up."

I climbed the fire escape ladder and went to where they shot off fireworks and waited for half the team to be on the field.  
Down the ladder, down into the locker room, I was the last one out, job done, made it to team photos with hair.

It took them a second to realize who I was, but when they did, they all started saying they're going to kick my ass, fuck me up, etc.  I gladly said 
“We shall see.”

The press wanted to do interviews due to my hair, but I do not like press and coach sent them on their way...he did not want the publicity either.

I went in the locker room, stood in front of my locker, taking off my shoulder pads, a teammate walked up, said "Come with me." "I ain't going no where with you" "You said we can shave your head as long as you make it to team photos" "I said no such thing" "You're coming with me or you're going to have a big problem."
I didn't say anything, figured lets see what they have.
As I walked aorund the corner of the lockers to the middle of the locker room, all of the coaches gave the eye to the team, to one another, walked out, and locked the doors.   
There was a trash can in the middle of the locker room and a teammate holding a pair of clippers.  He said "Grab the trash can" "Why" "We are going to shave your head, and you are going to hold that trash can while the entire team lines up and takes licks on you"
 "Lets see what you got"

They lined up and said do not hit him in the face because we have self-photos next.  (As in the coaches were up stairs making excuses as to why the team was late.)
The entire team, about 75 of them lined up, hit me many times each, as hard as they could.
The teammate with the clippers was furious by then "What the fuck! not one of you can get him down, y'all fucking suck, y'all can’t hit for shit."
They lined up and tried again, and failed.

I like poking bears, it's a hobby.

So I started laughing.

The teammate with the clippers had a much different look in his eye. "Think your bad, huh, take off your pants"
About 10 of the teammates were lined up behind me

They were going to gang rape me.

I smiled, looked at the fella with the clippers dead in the eyes, said "It's my turn."
I tossed the trash can, and started swinging.  2 of them down, 1 hit each, so a cake walk, I figured I could have the entire team in the hospital in 10 mintues.

Then Bra started screaming to leave me be and get away from me. (Later found out he was the drug dealer)
He said "We will get him later, and definitely on the field."

I had seen a lot in life, but never beating and gang raping someone over hair, that was a new one.

They did well on the field to try and hurt me, but a lifetime of getting beaten paid off.
The quarterback would throw the ball high so I had to jump to catch it, that way the linebackers and secondary could spear me in the ribs where I did not have pads.  That was hands down some of the worst pains I have ever felt, but I got used to it.

They would pull the old tricks where one person on the ground would roll into me and the other hit my leg trying to break my knee, but I had done that so many times I saw that coming a mile away.
We played dirty in high school, much dirtier than them, so I knew what they were doing before they moved a muscle.  My high school coach was the coach in the book Friday Night Lights, he was 1 mean mother fucker, so we got on just fine.

Off the field was a different story entirely.
The first party I went to, 5-6 teammates were standing in the living room, they were going to "kick my ass."
I fucked those litle boys up something wrong.
I had a new game.  Drink half a bottle of wild turkey and go beat the shit out of the team.
They would scatter like roaches when I came around, not even slightly joking, they would jump out windows, off roofs, etc.  I would no longer go through the front door, I'd walk to the front, hear them yell, then watch for them around the house running scared.

We came to a truce, so-to-speak, more nonverbal.  I wanted to have a social life and play football, and so did they…..with the little dignity they deserved.

Really didn't matter tho, the females only like guys with money and I was the brokest joke on the planet.  They preferred a cheating man with diseases and money over discipline and no money…..hindsight is 20/20, I can’t blame them

I very quickly was on the starting crew.  It began one day with Oklahoma drills.  My coach would never let me run with the starters, even though they were a joke at best.  So one day when coach was not paying attention I went in place of the starters, rocked the starting defensive tackles' world.  My coach ran up "Holy Shit XXXX, Is that you!!!" "Yes Sir" "Line up and do it again!" So I did….again, and again, and again. No one on the starting defense could stop me.
I even dislocated the starting defensive ends shoulder.
Those little boys would scream at me in practice 
“Quit hitting us so hard”

One day my weight lifting coach walked up to me, had my paperwork in hand, which stated how much weight I lift in workouts.  He said "Is this accurate" "Yes Sir" "Come with me" We went to the weight room, and did a workout.  I lifted all the weights on the paperwork, which I claimed I could do, in my mind to prove I am not a liar, but that was not his point at all.  He really didn't even speak when we were lifting, it was weird.  After the workout he said "Come to my office" I sat down and he said "What are you on?" "Nothing" "There are a lot of eyes on you right now, I'm not allowed to say who, but trust me, it is a lot.  I have gone through the files of the history of this school, and others have gone through their files too, you have gained strength faster than anyone on record.  Now I am going to ask you again, What are you on?" "Nothing" "This is your last chance, I can help you, but you must tell me what you are on, they are going to find out." "Sir, I do not take anything, not even aspirin." "OK"
The next day they started drug testing me, and only me, and many times in the weeks to come.  but I was raised Catholic, I seriously don't even take aspirin.

The team and I still never got along.  We went to a strip club, and then back to a teammates house.  He was handing out condoms to everyone, and I mean 30+ teammates.  He handed me one, I asked "What's this for?" "We brought back a stripper from the club, she is in the back room!" "That's fucking disgusting" he got furious, basically I said I can beat the shit out of all of y'all, or I can leave peacefully.  They did not want to fight, they wanted to stick their dick in each others nut.

One day in practice, it was starting defense vs. starting offense.  Every play was a run play behind me, and for some reason the players on the sideline were cheering.  We marched the ball down the field, per usual.  We were close to the other end of the field and the quarterback came into the huddle siad "You know they're cheering for you, right?" "Whey the fuck would they cheer for me?" "Look right in front of us, see those red shirts?  That is the entire staff of the Kansas City Chiefs.  You are going to be the first one and done in college.  We are sorry for what we did to you, now go be you."

They wanted me to get contacts because I couldnt catch the ball, and then they found out I was blind.  Dr. Parchue of Opthalmology Associates broke HIPPA laws and went straight to TCU, and I mean same day as the appointment, which I paid for, not TCU.
And no, there was no testing done, and his diagnosis was wrong.
but TCU obviously didn’t care

Football was lost.

I was at TCU on an academic scholarship.
That was just as bad.

English class 
myself and a teammate could never get higher than a C.  He was quite clever though, he knew something was up.  Prior to a paper being due, he went to someone high up in the English department, had them grade his paper, and he received an A+.  When he turned it in to our teacher, he receved a C-.  it was escalated, and we got with the team.  We discovered if you were a poor football player on scholarship a C is the highest grade you could get in her class….but I was on academic scholarship, so all was lost, again.

History class was the hardest class I have ever taken (I have a Master's degree currently, would have 3 but student loans maxed out).It was a text book with 6 sections.  Each section also had a separate book, which was usually 200-400 patges.  so 7 books total, which stacked up to my knee...for 1 class.  I accidentally read the incorrect book for the section, I went to the teacher to see if I could get an extension, she said "No, you have less than 24 hours to the test, read it." I read the book, but by the time I took the test my brain was fried.

I had math, and I was great at math.  In calcuclus you get to a subject called derivatives.  The answers are not easy to get, you can calculate the answer in a number of ways and it takes a long time to get there.  Not for me.  My first test I was done in less than 10 minutes.  My math teacher said I was the best student she had ever seen, and she had worked there for decades.  Didn't matter though, just English alone was enough to lose all scholarships.

Then comes psychology
 The teacher was also the author of the text book The teacher was pompous to say the least. he asked me to come to the front of the class for a simple experiment, I passed it, and in front of the entire class he calls me a cheat and that I someone broke into his office and knew this was coming.  I took the liberty of telling him off too. I think we might have been an experiment as a school, or maybe it is what society deems accurate, I am unsure. We had class Mon/Wed/Fri.  he made us watch the rape scene in Clockwork Orange every class for 3 weeks.  So 9 classes, watching that scene many times. I have the utmost respect for women, and I cannot watch such things.  I do not want to say what I will do to someone who tries to rape a woman, but lets say it's dire.  In other words I could not go to class, I can’t watch that shit

So TCU has a mandatory psychology class which shows women being raped over and over.  We have a football team who are rapists, and like to run trains on strippers.  There were 2 women raped on campus in the first few weeks of that year.  it was in the area behind my dorms, so my friend and I would monitor the area all night on weekends.  No females were raped after we started as such.
But still, you have a University, which is extremely expensive, and highly esteemed.  Why?
 It makes me think this is what rich people have submliminally taught to them.  Rape, pecking order, force, ends justify the means.
Since the day I lost my academic scholarship, I have been homeless a lot, and 
rarely have enough money to pay for food. 
I blame TCU.

If I had gone to any school on earth which doesn’t beat people over their hair, or fail football players because they’re poor, or teach kids to rape one another
I would probably have a wife and house and be happy

But I have none of that

If you have kids, or are a kid  looking for a college.  Choose a place you fit in.  If you’re poor, you won’t fit in at TCU, and I doubt other Ivy league schools.  Accept you’re poor and choose a school with poor people.  The rich will crush you, trust me, I am living proof.
if I had a daughter, not a chance in hell would she go to TCU

Who am I?

The team has taken a photo of the freshman football players since the start of the school, and 1 picture per year in the front office.
I am the only one with hair to his shoulders.

Currently I’m a blind homeless old man in hopes of helping someone not have as shitty a life as I do </p>
